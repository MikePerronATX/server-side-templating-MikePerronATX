        <p>
            The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to
            medieval Europe,passing through Rome and Venice
            in the 17th and 18th centuries to the French
            House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional
            revelry of "Boeuf Gras," or fatted calf, followed
            France to her colonies.
        </p>
        <p>
            On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean
            Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur de Bienville arrived at
            a plot of ground 60 miles directly south of New
            Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi Gras" when
            his men realized it was the eve of the festive
            holiday. Bienville also established "Fort Louis
            de la Louisiane" (which is now Mobile) in 1702.
            In 1703, the tiny settlement of Fort Louis de la
            Mobile celebrated America's very first Mardi Gras.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1704, Mobile established a secret society
            (Masque de la Mobile), similar to those that form
            our current Mardi Gras krewes. It lasted until 1709.
            In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society" was formed and
            paraded from 1711 through 1861. The procession was
            held with a huge bull's head pushed along on wheels
            by 16 men. Later, Rex would parade with an actual
            bull, draped in white and signaling the coming Lenten
            meat fast. This occurred on Fat Tuesday.
        </p>
        <p>
            New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville.
            By the 1730s, Mardi Gras was celebrated openly in
            New Orleans, but not with the parades we know today.
            In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor, the Marquis
            de Vaudreuil, established elegant society balls, which
            became the model for the New Orleans Mardi Gras balls
            of today.
        </p>
        <p>
            The earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears
            in a 1781 report to the Spanish colonial governing body.
            That year, the Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid
            Association was the first of hundreds of clubs and
            carnival organizations formed in New Orleans.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions
            of maskers with carriages and horseback riders to
            celebrate Mardi Gras. Dazzling gaslight torches, or
            "flambeaux," lit the way for the krewe's members and
            lent each event an exciting air of romance and festivity.
            In 1856, six young Mobile natives formed the Mistick
            Krewe of Comus, invoking John Milton's hero Comus to
            represent their organization. Comus brought magic and
            mystery to New Orleans with dazzling floats (known as
            tableaux cars) and masked balls. Krewe members remained
            anonymous.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1870, Mardi Gras' second Krewe, the Twelfth Night
            Revelers, was formed. This is also the first recorded
            account of Mardi Gras "throws."
        </p>
        <p>
            Newspapers began to announce Mardi Gras events in advance,
            and they even printed "Carnival Edition" lithographs of
            parades' fantastic float designs (after they rolled, of
            course - themes and floats were always carefully guarded
            before the procession). At first, these reproductions were
            small, and details could not be clearly seen. But beginning
            in 1886 with Proteus' parade "Visions of Other Worlds,"
            these chromolithographs could be produced in full, saturated
            color, doing justice to the float and costume designs of
            Carlotta Bonnecase, Charles Briton and B.A. Wikstrom. Each
            of these designers' work was brought to life by talented
            Parisian paper-mache' artist Georges Soulie', who for 40
            years was responsible for creating all of Carnival's floats
            and processional outfits.
        </p>
        <p>
            1872 was the year that a group of businessmen invented a King
            of Carnival, Rex, to preside over the first daytime parade.
            To honor the visiting Russian Grand Duke Alexis Romanoff, the
            businessmen introduced Romanoff's family colors of purple,
            green and gold as Carnival's official colors. Purple stands
            for justice; gold for power; and green for faith. This was also
            the Mardi Gras season that Carnival's improbable anthem, "If
            Ever I Cease to Love," was cemented, due in part to the Duke's
            fondness for the tune.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following year, floats began to be constructed entirely in
            New Orleans instead of France, culminating with Comus'
            magnificent "The Missing Links to Darwin's Origin of Species,"
            in which exotic paper-mache' animal costumes served as the basis
            for Comus to mock both Darwin's theory and local officials,
            including Governor Henry Warmoth. In 1875, Governor Warmoth
            signed the "Mardi Gras Act," making Fat Tuesday a legal holiday
            in Louisiana, which it still is.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Like Comus and the Twelfth Night Revelers, most Mardi Gras krewes
            today developed from private social clubs with restrictive
            membership policies. Since all of these parade organizations are
            completely funded by their members, New Orleanians call it the
            "Greatest Free Show on Earth!"
